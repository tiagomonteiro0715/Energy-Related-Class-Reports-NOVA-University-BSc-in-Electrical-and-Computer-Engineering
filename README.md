# Energy related classes reports at NOVA University from bachelor in eletrical and computer engineering

This repository contains academic laboratorial reports from classes related to the eletrical engineering subfiled called Energy.

In my bachelor degree, there was 2 classes on Energy:
- **Theoretical Electrotechnics**: Core electrical engineering principles and mathematical models
- **Electromechanical Energy Conversion**: Practical applications and theoretical foundations

When I did Theoretical Electrotechnics, 36%(more than 1 in every 3) failed the class and my grade I was a little bit above average:
- The 1.º Theoretical Electrotechnics report grade was of 15.5 out of 20
- The 2.º Theoretical Electrotechnics report grade was of 17.5 out of 20

When I did Electromechanical Energy Conversion, 35%(more than 1 in every 3) failed the class and my grade I was a little bit above average:
- The 1.º Electromechanical Energy Conversion report grade was of 14 out of 20
- The 2.º Electromechanical Energy Conversion report grade was of 13 out of 20

Energy is great, but it wasn’t my main focus during my bachelor’s degree. 

I was far more interested in math, physics, control theory, and AI, which I explored extensively through Coursera courses.
